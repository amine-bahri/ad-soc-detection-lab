# Detection Engineering and Attack Chain Evaluation in an Active Directory SOC Environment

A security operations project. I build a realistic SOC environment around an Active Directory domain, then use it to measure how well open-source detection tooling catches real adversary techniques: across two SIEMs, through full attack chains, under evasion, and through incident response.

Each detection is treated as a tested hypothesis, with positive and negative tests, resilience studies against controlled evasion, and documented limitations. The goal is an honest measurement of detection coverage and its gaps.

## Objectives

1. Deploy a realistic SOC lab: Active Directory, endpoint telemetry, two SIEMs for comparison, and a case-management stack for incident response.
2. Engineer detections (Sigma) across multiple MITRE ATT&CK tactics, deployed and validated in both SIEMs.
3. Design and execute multi-step attack scenarios and evaluate per-step detection: what fired, what was missed, where the gaps are.
4. Test detection resilience by modifying attacks to evade working rules, then improving the rules.
5. Take selected scenarios through a full incident response workflow, with IOC enrichment and SOC automation.
6. Produce a detection-coverage analysis (ATT&CK Navigator) and a Wazuh vs. Splunk comparative evaluation.

## Lab environment

| Component | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Windows Server (Domain Controller) | Active Directory domain `amine.local` (NetBIOS `AMINE`), DNS | built |
| Windows 10 (`Target-PC`) | Domain-joined workstation (monitored endpoint) | built |
| Sysmon | Endpoint telemetry on Windows hosts | done |
| Splunk (Ubuntu) | SIEM 1, log collection and detection | built |
| Kali Linux | Attack machine | built |
| Atomic Red Team | Attack simulation, mapped to ATT&CK | done |
| Wazuh | SIEM 2, for comparative detection analysis | planned |
| TheHive + Cortex | Case management and IOC enrichment (incident response) | planned |
| Suricata (200h extension) | Network-level IDS for host and network correlation | stretch |

## Methodology

Every detection ("analytic") is developed to a fixed definition of done:

1. Detection hypothesis: what behaviour is suspicious and why (a narrow, defensible claim).
2. Data contract: required log channels, event IDs, fields, audit and sensor config, verified before writing the rule.
3. Executable rule: Sigma, converted to both SIEMs.
4. Positive tests: controlled attack variants.
5. Negative tests: benign activity that exercises similar signals.
6. Results: expected vs. actual, with evidence.
7. Limitations: known misses and weak conditions.
8. Triage guidance: what an analyst checks next.

Attack outcomes are classified precisely (prevented, executed and detected, executed and missed, telemetry absent) because they mean very different things.

## Project phases

| Phase | Work | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Lab infrastructure | AD, Sysmon, Splunk, Kali, Atomic Red Team | done |
| | Wazuh (second SIEM), TheHive + Cortex | planned |
| 2. Detection engineering | Sigma rules across ATT&CK tactics, deployed to both SIEMs | active |
| 3. Attack chains | Multi-step scenarios, per-step detection evaluation | planned |
| 4. Resilience / evasion | Bypass own rules, analyse, improve, regression-test | planned |
| 5. Incident response and automation | Full cases in TheHive, IOC enrichment, Python automation, SOAR | planned |
| 6. Analysis and reporting | ATT&CK Navigator coverage heatmap, Wazuh vs. Splunk comparison, report | planned |

The project is currently in Phase 2. Detection analytics are built Splunk-first, then re-deployed and compared on Wazuh in Phase 6.
